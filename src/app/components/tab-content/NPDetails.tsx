                        <p className="mb-2">
                            NP problems are significant in computer science because they include many problems that are critical in various fields such as cryptography, scheduling, and optimization. The relationship between NP problems and another class called P (problems that can be solved in polynomial time) is a central question in computational complexity theory.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-2">
                            The famous open question, "Does P equal NP?" asks whether every problem for which a solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. <strong>This question remains one of the most important unsolved problems in computer science.</strong>

                    <p className="mb-2">
                        <strong>Verification:</strong> The process of checking whether a given solution to a decision problem results in a 
                        "yes" result or a "no" result.

                            traveling salesperson (TSP), independent set, Hamiltonian path, and Hamiltonian cycle.

                        <p className="mb-2">
                           One method used in proving that a prolem is in NP is to construct a method of mapping instances
                           of one NP problem to another. The reduction is successful if we can always map an arbitrary yes instance
                           of one problem to a yes instance of the problem we're trying to prove is in NP, and likewise for false
                           instances.
                           <br /><br />
                           For example, the reduction from 3SAT to vertex cover could be depicted as:
